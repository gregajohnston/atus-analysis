# Introduction

This module imports data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). The subsequent data is parsed and simple statistics are generated. These results are displayed in a Jupyter notebook named *Results.ipynb*.

## Requirements

All required files are listed in the *requirements.txt* file. To run, type "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your OS command line. There are no other files to install to make the program work, simply copy all of the contents into a directory and open *Results.ipynb* from the command line or from <https://github.com/gregj126/atus-analysis/blob/master/Results.ipynb>.

## Files

Included in this module are: README.md; Results.ipynb, Scratch.ipynb, atus\_analysis.py, atus\_analysis\_test.py, requirements.txt.

Scratch.ipynb is a practice file to orient using the database, and is not meant to be viewed for data output. Atus\_analysis.py runs the plotting logic. Atus\_analysis\_test.py is for debugging purposes only.
